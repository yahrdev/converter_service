# ðŸŽ§ converter_service

**This microservice converts files (like mp4 to wav) and is easy to test, change, and grow**

It uses a clean and simple architecture, so the code is easy to read and extend. Errors are handled clearly, and tests are included. You can use this service alone or inside a bigger project.
