# ðŸŽ§ converter_service

**This microservice converts files (for example, from mp4 to wav) and is built with architecture thatâ€™s easy to test and extend.**

The design follows SOLID principles and separates logic into small, focused parts:
- File handling
- Conversion logic
- API layer
- Error handling
  
This makes it easier to change or add new features, like supporting other file types (e.g., txt â†’ pdf). The service also includes unit and integration tests and returns clear error messages when something goes wrong.

You can use it as a standalone tool or integrate it into a bigger system.
